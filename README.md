# Boids Algorithm

Our project is a boids algorithm sandbox implemented as a web application using React, NextJS, and p5.js. The sandbox allows users to explore and experiment with the behavior of a flock of boids, using a variety of controls and settings. The boids algorithm is a widely studied model of flocking behavior that simulates the movement of birds or other animals in a swarm. It has been used in a range of applications, including computer graphics, robotics, and artificial life.
